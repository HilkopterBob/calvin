# üöÄ Installation

Girok supports all operating systems including Linux, MacOS, Windows.

However, it works well on linux-based shells such as `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `git-bash`, etc.

Some shells like `powershell` might break some UIs.

1. Make sure you have Python `>3.9` version installed.
2. Enter the following in your terminal

```bash
pip install girok
```

Now you have installed `girok` on your machine. To make sure that it works, enter the following.

```bash
girok --help
```

Now, let's dive into Girok!

# üî• Get Started

## 1. Help command

In order to see **all the commands** of **Girok**, enter `girok --help` in your terminal.

![](images/girok-help.png)

In order to see the details of each command, enter the following in your terminal.

```
girok <command> --help
```

For example, if you enter

```
girok addtask --help
```

then you'll see the following help message

## 2. Register

To register a new account enter the following in your terminal.

```bash
girok register
```

![](images/girok-register.png)

Congratulations! Now let's go ahead and login to our account.

## 3. Login and Logout

In order to login with your registered account, enter the following command.

```bash
girok login
```

![](images/girok-login.png)

Now you're ready to use all the features.

## 4. Category Commands

You can pre-define **categories** such as `School`, `Life` and `Career` with automatically assigned category color.

Girok supports **infinite recursive subcategories**. All the subcategories will be assigned with the color of its topmost parent category.

Later on, you can link tasks to these categories.

### 4.1 `showcat` command

In order to see all the categories you have created, enter the following command.

By default, `No Category` category is set (later for tasks which have no category).

```bash
girok showcat
```

### 4.2 `addcat` command

`addtask` command takes a single argument `category full path`.

In order to add a new category, enter the following command.

```bash
girok addcat <target path>
```

The `<target path>` is the **full path including the new category name**. For example, if you want to add a **topmost category** named `Career`, then enter

```bash
girok addcat Career
```

Then, you'll see the category tree with the newly created category being highlighted.

![](images/girok-addcat1.png)

In order to nest a sub-category under a previously defined category, pass the **FULL PATH** starting from the topmost category delimited by `/`, ending with the new category name.

For example, if you want to create a new category named `Resume` under the previously created `Career` category, enter the following command.

```bash
girok addcat Career/Resume
```

Then, you'll see `Resume` is created under `Career`.

![](images/girok-addcat2.png)

In this way, you can create as many categories and sub-categories as you want!

### 4.3 `mvcat` command

Now you might want to move a category under another category.

In order to move a `category A` (recursively all its sub-categories) under `category B`, enter the following command.

```bash
girok mvcat <full path of A> <full path of B>
```

For example, if you want to move the whole `Career` category under `Dev/Network` (for some weird reason), enter the following command.

```bash
girok mvcat Career Dev/Network
```

![](images/girok-addcat4.png)

If you want to move a category to the `root category`, then pass `/` as the second argument. Let's move `Dev/Network/Career` back to the topmost category.

```bash
girok mvcat Dev/Network/Career /
```

![](images/girok-addcat5.png)

### 4.4 `rmcat` command

Of course, you want to delete a category. In that case, enter the following command.

```bash
girok rmcat <full path of category>
```

Let's add a dummy category named `Dummy` under `Dev` then remove it.

As you already know, enter

```bash
git addcat Career/Dummy
```

![](images/girok-addcat6.png)

Now, let's delete it with the following command.

```bash
girok rmcat Career/Dummy
```

Then, you'll be asked to confirm the deletion. Enter `y`.

![](images/girok-rmcat1.png)

Great job! Now let's move on to the task commands.
